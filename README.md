# STAR WARS Cantina

### Inspiration
The motivating force for this project was my love for Star Wars. It is my belief that any Star Wars fan will appreciate this easy to use application. 

### Description
This is a RESTful single page application that uses JSON-server to GET and POST data. The data comprises characters from the STAR WARS saga. This app will be useful to someone who wants to add data for searchable Star Wars characters. The data appears as character cards. Cards can be easiy added and deleted, updating a db.json based server.

### Features
  - Each character is able to be deleted.
  - New characters may be added to and shown in the full list. 
  - Characters may be searched for with the search bar. 
  - Characters may be sorted by name or by their power levels. 
  - New characters may be added with all of their details. 

### Installation
  - Clone this repository into your home environment.
  - Open the repo in your text editor (i.e. VS Code).
  - CD inside of the star-wars-cantina folder.
